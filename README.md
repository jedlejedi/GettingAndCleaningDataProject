Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
==============================

This repository contains all the files required for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:

* README.md (this file): Contains a description of the files in the repository
* run_analysis.R: R script that merges the train and test sets from the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset* into a single data frame as required for the assignment. For the script to run, the R working directory must be set to the parent of the directory where the files of the HAR data set are stored.
* CookBook.md: Description of the data frame generated by the run_analysis.R script as well as the transformations applied to the HAR Dataset to get to that data frame.
